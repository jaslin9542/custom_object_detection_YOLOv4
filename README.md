# custom_object_detection_YOLOv4
Implementation of custom object detection model for space debris detection using YOLOv4 with darknet as backbone. 

Images of space debris collected from google and annotated the image data using LabelIMG open source tool. The annotated image data was trained and tested using YOLOv4 model. The model consists of only 2 classes that are space debris and satellite. The model was trained for 6000 iteraions. For 1000 and 2000 iterations the model provided the desired output.
